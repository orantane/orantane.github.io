					<p>In this project the goal was to create a function that could read a line from a file and return it as a string.
						The function also needed to remember its position in the file, so that when it was called upon again, it would read
						the following line instead of the same one every time.
					</p>
					<p>This was my third project at Hive Helsinki and it was to be added into the library I had built as my previous project.
						The function would be used a lot in upcoming projects, so efficiency was important. There were also bonus points to be had
						if the function only had one static variable. With these things in mind I set up to create the most efficient and fast
						function I could come up with. The task itself was simple, but while trying to achieve the best efficiency the implementation
						went through multiple revisions until I was happy with the performance.
					</p>
					<p>On school projects we are usually not allowed to use pre-existing function libraries or functions outside of a few which are disclosed in the assignement. For this project, I was allowed to use malloc, free and write functions.

						Every school project also has similar baseline requirements, however they can change a bit depending on what is the goal of the project. For this project, the requirements were: The program/function/library must not have any memory leaks. 
						It must not crash at any point. It's forbidden to use global variables. The code must be written in accordance with the Norm (Norm is a set of rules on how to format the code, so that everyone at the school has code that others can easily read). 
						The function needs to fit within a file that contains a maximum of five functions and 25 lines per function. The function is prototyped as "int  get_next_line(int fd, char **line)". The first parameter is the file descriptor that will be used to read.
						The second parameter is the address of a pointer to a character that will be used to save the line read from the file descriptor. The function must save the line without the newline character. The return value can be 1, 0 or -1 depending on whether a 
						line has been read, when the reading has been completed, or if an error has happened respectively. 
					</p>
					<p>Bonus points could be earned if the function only had a single static variable and if it was able to handle the reading of multiple file descriptors at 
						the same time without losing the reading thread on each of the descriptors. In my project I managed to complete both of these bonuses by using a static array of pointers, one pointer for each file descriptor.
					</p>
					<p>For benchmarking I downloaded a .txt file of an ebook that had over 100 000 lines of text. I then wrote a simple program that
						would read the book line by line and print out the result at the same time using the printf function. Once I achieved a time
						that was under 10 seconds with the school iMac, I was happy with the functions performance. I then added the function to the libft
						library.
