					<p>The aim of this project was to code a C library regrouping useful functions that I was then allowed to use in all my other school projects.</p>

					<p>This was one of the first school projects I did. The task was explained like this: "C programming can 
					be very tedious when one doesn’t have access to those highly useful
					standard functions. This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions,
					understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
					projects". The required functions were also mostly defined and included mostly functions that are available in some standard
					C-libraries. On school projects we are usually not allowed to use pre-existing function libraries or functions outside of a 
					few which are disclosed in the assignement. For this project, I was allowed to use malloc, free and write functions.</p>
					<p>Every school project has similar baseline requirements, however they can change a bit depending on what is the goal of the project.
					The requirements are: The project must include a Makefile that will compile the project with '-Wall -Wextra -Werror' flags. The makefile must also be able to recompile and
					clean the project files. The program/function/library must not have any memory leaks. It must not crash at any point. It's forbidden to use global
					variables. The code must be written in accordance with the Norm (Norm is a set of rules on how to format the code, so that everyone at the
					school has code that others can easily read).
					</p>
					<div class="center-image"><img src="../images/ft_itoa.png" class="paragraph-image"></div>
					<div class="subtitle">An example of a task to create a function.</div>
					<p>This project was a fairly simple one. My approach was to find the most simple and efficient ways of building the functions. That way
					in the future when I'll use the library on my other projects, the library would be as clean and efficient as possible. Overall the library
					includes over 50 different functions starting from a simple "Write a character using write" to linked list functions and itoa_base. I have
					refined the library over the course of using it on other projects. If a function was already available in some C function library, it was expected
					that it should be recoded to function exactly the same.
