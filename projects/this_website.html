					<p>I first started to build this website for the Roger_Skyline project, because I was required to host a website on my own web server. It could have been just a simple almost empty HTML website, since the project was more about
						network administration. However I got interested about HTML and how it worked. I had zero experience in web development, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so I decided to look into it. Ten hours later I had a decent understanding on
						how the three languages worked together to form a functioning website, so I decided to make a real functioning website for the project. The next day I had finished the first draft of the website, which only consisted
						of the current "Projects" and "Contact" pages and which didn't contain any functionality other than a few transitions and animations. During the building of the site, I decided that one day I'd expand upon it and create my own
						profile website where I could illustrate and explain the coding projects I've made and participated in.
					</p>
					<p>A year later I've now finished my first set of studies at Hive Helsinki and it's time to find an internship position. I figured it would be beneficial to have the website up and running during the application process.
						So I created a landing page, added some functionality and design to make it look better. I added links for the "Projects" page and created the project pages themself. In each project page I explain what the project is and why it exists.
						Most of the projects so far are school assignements for Hive, since most of my work outside of school are not full projects, but more about just learning new tools and workflows.</p>
					<p>Overall HTML and CSS are fairly intuitive languages for me to use and I learned the basics in a few days. I'm by no means an expert at them,
						but I feel like this website showcases my ability to learn new technologies relevantly well.
